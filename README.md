# ---- The Multi-input CNN algorithm 
# The Multi-input CNN algorithm is written in Matlab. The Multi-input CNN has 4 input channels. 
# 3 channels (RGB) for data obtained from optical sensor and 1 channel for data IR sensor heatmap.
# The IR layer  are cross link to the RGB layer after downscale to allow the RGB layers to "see" the feature of the heatmap.
# As such allow the RGB layer to correlate to temperature measurement.

# ---- The PLay LGBM
# The algorithm is a trial algorithm to evaluate the performance of the LGBM.

# ---- BaysianOpt 
# The algorithm is a trial algorithm to evaluate the model performance after optimize using Baysian optimization.
